# HTML-CSS
This folder contains all of my HTML and CSS projects, including those that are currently WIP. It allows me to work on the same file from any device, but I decided to make it public cos why not. 

Most of my assignments and tests have been published to the school server, and can be accessed through www1.hci.edu.sg/221538L/filename

Please do **NOT** copy my code. You may refer to them for ideas though. Any abuse to this platform and I'll make it private.

All projects built on VSC, with the help of Prettier to format the code (which I strongly reccomend).

You can access my HTML/CSS notes here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nuE9fXGDpHq9FZVWKTB2_4j0hhASjOiRDBbx53IwlZ0/edit?usp=sharing

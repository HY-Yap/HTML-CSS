# HTML-CSS
This folder contains all of my HTML and CSS projects, including those that are currently WIP. All my assignments and tests have been published to the school server, and can be accessed through www1.hci.edu.sg/221538L/filename

All projects built on VSC, with the help of Prettier to format the code.

You can access my HTML/CSS notes here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nuE9fXGDpHq9FZVWKTB2_4j0hhASjOiRDBbx53IwlZ0/edit?usp=sharing

        Superman was born on the fictional planet Krypton and was named Kal-El.
        As a baby, his parents sent him to Earth in a small spaceship moments
        before Krypton was destroyed in a natural cataclysm. His ship landed in
        the American countryside, near the fictional town of Smallville. He was
        found and adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named him
        Clark Kent. Clark developed various superhuman abilities, such as
        incredible strength and impervious skin.
